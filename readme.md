A Web App that has the functionality to upload a CSV. Letâ€™s say the CSV has fields Name, Age, Sex(M/F). The data inputted from CSV should be viewable in another page in a Tabular format with the option of editing existing entries. For each row in the tabular view, the user should be able to Edit/Delete Name, Age, Sex for each corresponding row entry.
